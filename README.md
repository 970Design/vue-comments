# What is Vue Comments?

Vue Comments is a [Vue](https://vuejs.org/) 3 component which allows you to render and process comments in a headless [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/) environment via the Companion [WordPress Plugin](https://github.com/970Design/nsz-vue-comments-plugin).  This component will work in any environment where Vue is supported (such as [Astro.js](https://astro.build/)).  Currently, it supports both rendering and submitting comments, and (optionally) Google reCAPTCHA v3.

## Setup Guide

- Install and active the companion [Vue Comments Plugin](https://github.com/970Design/nsz-vue-comments-plugin) in your headless WordPress site, configure it with your allowed origins and get your API Key.  You can additionally configure reCAPTCHA v3 if desired.
- Install this package in your front-end project using npm (or your favorite package manager):
    - `npm install @970design/vue-comments`
- Import and use the `VueComments` component in your front-end project, passing the required props (see example below) - including the `apiKey` which is provided by the companion WordPress plugin.

## Example Usage (with Astro.js)

```javascript
---
import VueComments from "@970design/vue-comments";

const postID = 1;
const endpoint = 'https://my-headless-wordpress.com';
const apiKey = import.meta.env.COMMENTS_API_KEY;
---

	<VueComments
		client:load
		post_id={postID}
		endpoint={endpoint}
		api_key={apiKey}
	/>
```

You can also include our default styling by importing the CSS file:

```css
import '@970design/vue-comments/dist/style.css';
```
